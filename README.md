# Neural Networks - A learning project exploring how neural nets work by writing one from scratch.

The intention is two fold: to gain a thorough understanding of neural network basics by building one from the ground up; also, gain a thorough grounding in F# 4.0 concepts and idioms
At a later stage a C# version will be added to allow me to explore a comparision of OOP concepts vs FP concepts in this domain.
The C# version will explore appropriate design patterns and SOLID principles.

At time of writing a simple perceptron with a parameterised vector function has been implemented. In neural network terms, this 
is a basic (and old fashioned) building block. In F# terms, passing in a function and simple pattern matching is as advanced as it gets.

Until the next version that is!
